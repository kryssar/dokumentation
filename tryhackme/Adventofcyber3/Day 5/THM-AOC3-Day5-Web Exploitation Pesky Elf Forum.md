login to the elf forum and click any of the posts. 

Create a new post with the content: 
`<script>fetch('/settings?new_password=pass123');</script>`

wait for about a minute and then try to login as the grinch, with password: `pass123`
it should be successful because the grinch is moderating the forum quite frequently.

deactivate the buttmas plugin to receive flag: `THM{NO_MORE_BUTTMAS}`
