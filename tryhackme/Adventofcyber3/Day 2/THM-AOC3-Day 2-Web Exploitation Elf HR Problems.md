Todays challenge, static site on: [Best Festival Monitoring](https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/aoc-cookies/)

register an account: 
user: test
mail: testing@test.se
pass:testing123

when trying to create an account, a warning about we're not allowed to create an account yet pops up: 
![[thm-aoc3-day2-1.png]]

a cookie is created, called: user-auth
```code
user-auth:"7b636f6d70616e793a2022546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c206973726567697374657265643a2254727565222c20757365726e616d653a2274657374227d"
```

with some default values like Domain, HostOnly and such.

type of encoding on the value: Hexadecimal

{company: "The Best Festival Company", isregistered:"True", username:"test"}

it's stored in object format: JSON

Use [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) to create a new hex-value for, so we change the "username" to "admin" instead of "test".

resulting value for the cookie:
```code
7b636f6d70616e793a2022546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c206973726567697374657265643a2254727565222c20757365726e616d653a2261646d696e227d
```

manipulate the "value" portion in the browser for the user-auth cookie and refresh the webpage.
