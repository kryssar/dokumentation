Nothing special today, just a quiz to see what career path to choose from. Initially i got incident responder, but i'm not one much for paper-pushing. 

Personally i prefer the more nitty gritty stuff, a techie at heart. Which means, if there's forensics/digging and such involved i'm definitely game for that.
