Today we get to attack a box and experiment with content discovery.

The address of the server is on tryhackme.com's network so first we need to connect the attacking box via VPN to that network. 

target IP: 10.10.73.115

If surfing to the IP address, a neat webpage is shown where you can register a user and browse around.

But we're more interested in finding other juicy treats. 
```code
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -t 40 -u http://10.10.73.115/
